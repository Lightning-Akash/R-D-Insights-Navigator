# R-D-Insights-Navigator
The project aims to develop an intelligent natural language search system to derive insights from R&amp;D reports and findings stored in PowerPoint presentations in a shared folder. The system will automatically extract knowledge and provide relevant information based on user queries, helping researchers quickly find the information they need.
